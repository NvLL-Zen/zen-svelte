        Hi there, the name's Fauzan Rizky Naufal. But you can just call me
        Ojan, i'm a highschool student in Indonesia. And since i was
        a kid, i am super interested in learning about computers and the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
        My journey begins when i was in 6th grade and in that time, i want to make
        my own minecraft mods using Java. But i accidentally stumbled upon a Python
        programming book in a library instead, and since then, it became my go to language.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aside from the world of programming, i usually unwind myself with playing
        videogames. Both videogames and programming have been my favorite things
        since i was a child, they have a special place in my heart that i will 
        never forget.
    </p>
